## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Employee Management API** built using **Flask**, **Flask-RESTful**, and **Flasgger** for API documentation with Swagger. The API allows for basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an in-memory list of employees. Swagger integration provides easy-to-navigate API documentation, and it helps with testing and validating API requests and responses directly through a user-friendly web interface.

### Features

- **Create** a new employee.
- **Retrieve** the list of all employees.
- **Update** the details of an existing employee.
- **Delete** an employee by their ID.
- **Swagger Documentation** for easy API testing.

The API is useful for understanding how RESTful APIs work, and it is designed with simplicity and scalability in mind. Swagger documentation can be accessed via the `/apidocs` endpoint after running the app, allowing you to test and validate the API.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building web applications in Python.
- **Flask-RESTful**: An extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs.
- **Flasgger**: A library that integrates Swagger UI to generate API documentation and support testing.
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop this project.
